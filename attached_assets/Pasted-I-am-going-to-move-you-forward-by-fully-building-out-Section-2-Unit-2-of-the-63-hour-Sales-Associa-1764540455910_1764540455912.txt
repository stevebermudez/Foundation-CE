Lesson 2.1 Script

Real Estate License Law, DBPR, DRE, FREC
(You can read this verbatim into Sora. I will write it in a natural teaching tone, but tight.)

Welcome back to FoundationCE and the Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

In this lesson, we will build your foundation in Florida license law. Before you learn what you may or may not do as a licensee, you need to know who makes the rules and why those rules exist.

Florida has a long history of regulating real estate. Real estate is a large target for fraud, misrepresentation, and abuse. The law is designed to protect the public, not to protect licensees. The guiding purpose behind the licensing system is consumer protection.

The modern structure of regulation in Florida starts with three main entities:

The Department of Business and Professional Regulation, called DBPR.

The Division of Real Estate, called DRE.

The Florida Real Estate Commission, called FREC.

DBPR is an umbrella agency in the executive branch of state government. It regulates many professions, including contractors, cosmetologists, and real estate licensees. DBPR issues licenses, investigates complaints, and can initiate disciplinary action.

The Division of Real Estate is a part of DBPR that handles administrative and ministerial work specific to real estate and appraisal regulation. The DRE provides support for FREC, maintains license records, and coordinates the examination process.

The Florida Real Estate Commission, FREC, is the rulemaking and disciplinary body for real estate licensees. FREC members are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. FREC adopts rules, interprets Chapter 475 of the Florida Statutes, and imposes discipline when licensees violate license law.

Several important chapters of Florida law control your practice as a licensee. You should know them by number:

Chapter 20 of the Florida Statutes sets out the organizational structure of the executive branch, including DBPR.

Chapter 455 provides general regulation for professions and occupations under DBPR.

Chapter 475 is the primary real estate license law. It defines real estate services, license types, disciplinary grounds, and the Real Estate Recovery Fund.

Chapter 120 sets out administrative procedure, including rulemaking and hearings.

Rule Chapter 61J2 of the Florida Administrative Code contains the detailed rules adopted by FREC. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

When you see a test question that asks which law controls a particular issue, train your brain to think in terms of these chapters and rules. For example, if the question involves escrow recordkeeping, it is probably covered by Chapter 475 and Rule 61J2, not by a local ordinance or the federal Fair Housing Act.

To summarize this segment, remember three things:

DBPR is the umbrella agency.

DRE is the back office that handles real estate administration.

FREC is the board that writes rules, interprets the law, and disciplines licensees.

In the next segment, we will move from the agencies that regulate you to the requirements you must meet to obtain a Florida sales associate license.

You can drop in slides that visually show:

DBPR hierarchy.

FREC composition and authority.

Lesson 2.2 Script

License categories, qualifications, application, background, education

Use this for another 20 to 25 minute narrated segment. You can split into shorter clips in the LMS if you prefer.

In this lesson, we are going to talk about you as an applicant. What does Florida expect from you before it will grant you a sales associate license

First, let us define the license categories. There are three basic categories in residential brokerage:

Sales associate.

Broker.

Broker associate. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

A sales associate performs real estate services for compensation but must work under the direction and control of an employing broker or owner developer. A broker may work for themselves, own a brokerage, and supervise sales associates and broker associates. A broker associate has a broker license, but chooses to work under the supervision of another broker instead of operating independently.

Now let us look at the basic qualifications for a sales associate license. Florida requires that you:

Be at least 18 years old.

Have a high school diploma or its equivalent.

Have a United States Social Security number.

Be honest, trustworthy, and of good moral character. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

You do not have to be a United States citizen, but you must satisfy the requirements for qualification of immigrants for examination under Florida law. The state is mainly concerned with your honesty and your record.

The application itself is more than a formality. You must respond accurately and completely to every question about your background. If you have ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime, or if you have ever entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, even if adjudication was withheld or the record was sealed or expunged, you must carefully follow the instructions on the application. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

Failure to disclose is often worse than the underlying offense. Many applications are denied not because of the original conduct but because the applicant failed to disclose it. When in doubt, disclose.

After you submit the application and pay the required fees, DBPR orders a background check. Your fingerprints are taken and compared to state and federal criminal databases. The Division of Real Estate prepares a Summary of Applicants (often abbreviated as SOA), which provides FREC with information needed to approve or deny your application. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

Each application is valid for a limited period. If you do not complete the licensure process and pass the exam within that time, you may have to reapply and pay additional fees.

Next we look at education. The standard rule is that an applicant must complete a state approved pre license course for sales associates before taking the state exam. The course is commonly known as FREC Course I, and it consists of at least 63 hours including the final exam. There are some exemptions for attorneys and certain college degree holders, but those are tested as exceptions. The rule is that education is required, and the exception is that certain applicants may be exempt. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

After completing the pre license course and passing the school exam, you are eligible to take the state licensure examination. Once you pass the state exam and DBPR issues your license, you are not finished with education. You must complete post licensing education before your first renewal, and then ongoing continuing education for every renewal after that. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

In the next lesson, we will cover licensure versus registration, mutual recognition, who must be licensed, exemptions from licensure, and unlicensed activity.

Lesson 2.3 Script

Registration vs licensure, mutual recognition, who must be licensed, exemptions, unlicensed activity

In this final lesson for Unit 2, we will connect the license to the work you are allowed to perform.

First, let us separate two key terms: registration and licensure. Registration is the placement of your name and address on the official record. Licensure is the legal authorization to practice a regulated profession. The state may require both registration and licensure, but a license is what authorizes you to perform real estate services. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

Florida also has mutual recognition agreements with certain other states. Under these agreements, a licensee in another state may obtain a Florida license without taking the full pre license course, provided they meet the experience and law exam requirements and are not Florida residents as defined by statute. Mutual recognition is not reciprocity. It is a specific agreement between Florida and certain states. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

Now let us clarify who must be licensed. Real estate services in Florida include advertising, buying, appraising, renting, selling, exchanging, leasing, and managing real property for another and for compensation. If a person performs any of these services for someone else for a fee, commission, or other valuable consideration, that person usually must hold an active real estate license. 

FREC1SyllabusCleanFinal01012023

The law also lists several exemptions. For example, owners who handle their own real estate, salaried employees of an owner or of a registered broker or owner developer who perform limited duties, attorneys in fact acting under a power of attorney, and certain government employees performing official duties may be exempt from licensure when acting within the scope of the exemption. You must learn which exemptions exist and where they end.

Unlicensed activity is a serious violation. A person who performs real estate services for another for compensation without a required license can face criminal penalties, administrative fines, and civil liability. Licensees who assist or cooperate with unlicensed activity also risk discipline. Exam questions often describe a scenario where an unlicensed assistant does too much: negotiating commission, giving legal advice, or showing property without supervision.

As you complete this unit, keep asking: Is this person performing real estate services for another and for compensation If the answer is yes, a license is probably required unless an exemption clearly applies.

That concludes Unit 2. You are now ready for the Unit 2 quiz.
