“FREC Composition, Makeup & Purpose”

Welcome to Unit 3 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre-Licensing Course.

Now that you understand how DBPR and the Division of Real Estate support licensing, it is time to focus on the Florida Real Estate Commission, known as FREC. FREC is the centerpiece of your regulatory world. It writes rules, interprets statutes, disciplines licensees, and protects consumers.

The mission of FREC is simple: protect the public by regulating real estate practice in Florida. Everything FREC does must align with consumer protection.

Let us begin with how FREC is structured. FREC is a seven-member commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Florida Senate.

Four members must be licensed brokers with at least five years of active experience.

One member must be a licensed broker or sales associate with at least two years of active licensure.

Two members must be consumer members with no connection to the real estate industry.

At least one member must be sixty years of age or older.

Terms are staggered four-year terms, and no member may serve more than two consecutive terms. FREC must meet at least monthly, but it may meet more frequently when needed.

FREC operates with public transparency. Meetings are open to the public except for portions involving discipline where confidentiality is permitted by law. Disciplined licensees, rule changes, and administrative cases are all handled through formal, recorded proceedings.

Remember this: exam questions often test the composition of FREC and the special requirement that two members must be consumer members. Focus on that distinction because it shows how Florida balances industry expertise with the public interest.

In summary, FREC’s formation, membership structure, and purpose all tie back to consumer protection. In the next lesson, you will learn the powers the Commission exercises and how those powers impact your daily practice.

LESSON 3.2 — SCRIPT (approx 55 minutes of content)

“Powers, Duties & Rulemaking Authority”

In this lesson, we dive into the authority of the Florida Real Estate Commission. FREC operates under three main categories of power: ministerial, quasi-legislative, and quasi-judicial.

Ministerial powers are administrative tasks, such as maintaining records, certifying licenses, and preparing and publishing information. These actions do not involve discretion.

Quasi-legislative powers involve FREC’s authority to make rules. These rules become part of the Florida Administrative Code under Rule Chapter 61J2. FREC uses these powers to interpret and implement Chapter 475 of the Florida Statutes. The Commission cannot create laws; it can only adopt rules that enforce or clarify existing statutes.

Examples include rules on escrow procedures, advertising standards, and license renewal procedures.

Quasi-judicial powers allow FREC to discipline licensees, impose fines, suspend or revoke licenses, issue reprimands, and grant or deny applications. FREC acts like a court in these circumstances.

FREC may:

Adopt a seal

Make rules

Decide questions of practice

Impose discipline

Grant or deny licensure

Determine if a licensee has violated Chapter 475 or a FREC rule

Discipline may include a reprimand, administrative fine, probation, suspension, or revocation.

One special authority is a summary suspension, which may be issued when a licensee poses an immediate, serious danger to the public. This is extremely rare but very testable.

Another authority is prima facie evidence, which means “on its face.” A current, valid real estate license issued by DBPR is prima facie evidence that the licensee is properly licensed.

As you study, remember the three categories: ministerial, quasi-legislative, and quasi-judicial. The exam often asks which type of power FREC is exercising in a particular scenario.

In the next lesson, we apply these powers to the lifecycle of a license, including renewal, discipline, and license status changes.

LESSON 3.3 — SCRIPT (approx 55 minutes of content)

“Licensing, Renewals, Status Changes & Discipline”

In this final lesson for Unit 3, we connect FREC’s authority to the real-world lifecycle of your license.

Every licensee in Florida must renew their license every two years. Renewal dates follow the month of your original issuance. You must complete post-licensing education before your first renewal and continuing education after that.

If you fail to renew on time, your license becomes involuntarily inactive. An involuntarily inactive license may be reactivated within a prescribed period by completing the required continuing education or by taking the 28-hour reactivation course.

Failing to reactivate the license within the allowed time results in the license becoming null and void. Null and void means the license no longer exists.

FREC also regulates changes in employment. A sales associate or broker associate may only work for one employer at a time. When you change employers, you must notify the state and update your license record. Advertising and escrow handling are tied to the broker of record, not to the associate personally.

FREC enforces compliance through disciplinary actions. If a complaint is filed, DBPR may investigate. If probable cause is found, a formal complaint may be issued and the case may go before FREC in a quasi-judicial capacity.

Penalties can include reprimand, fines, probation, suspension, or revocation. The Real Estate Recovery Fund may compensate injured parties for certain damages caused by a licensee, but the licensee must later reimburse the Fund.

To stay active and in good standing, remember the three keys:

Renew on time.

Complete required education.

Follow advertising, escrow, and practice rules.

That concludes Unit 3. You are now ready for the quiz.
