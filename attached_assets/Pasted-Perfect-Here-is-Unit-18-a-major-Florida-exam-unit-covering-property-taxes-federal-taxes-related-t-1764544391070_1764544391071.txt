LESSON 18.1 SCRIPT

Property Taxes, Assessed Value, Exemptions, Taxable Value

Welcome to Unit 18 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

This unit explains property taxes, exemptions, federal tax rules, depreciation, capital gains, and tax deferred exchanges. These topics appear regularly on the Florida exam.

Florida real estate taxes are ad valorem taxes. The term ad valorem means based on value.

The county property appraiser determines assessed value. Market value is an estimate of what the property would sell for. Assessed value is market value minus any assessment limitations and adjustments.

Florida offers several exemptions. The homestead exemption is the most important. A Florida resident who owns and occupies a property as a primary residence may receive up to fifty thousand dollars of exemption. The first twenty five thousand applies to all property taxes. The second twenty five thousand applies only to non school taxes.

Additional exemptions may apply to widows, widowers, individuals who are blind, disabled veterans, and seniors who qualify under income guidelines.

After exemptions are applied, the result is taxable value.

Property taxes are calculated by multiplying taxable value by the millage rate. Millage is expressed as dollars per thousand dollars of taxable value.

For example, if taxable value is one hundred thousand dollars and the millage rate is twenty mills, taxes equal two thousand dollars.

Later in this unit we study the Save Our Homes cap which limits annual increases in assessed value.

In the next lesson, we examine federal tax rules affecting real estate.

LESSON 18.2 SCRIPT

Depreciation, Basis, Capital Gains, Federal Taxation

In this lesson, we study federal income tax rules for homeowners and real estate investors.

Homeowners may deduct mortgage interest and property taxes on a primary residence. They cannot deduct repairs or improvements.

Investors may deduct operating expenses, mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, management fees, and depreciation.

Depreciation is cost recovery for income producing property. Land cannot be depreciated, but improvements can be. Residential rental property is depreciated over twenty seven and a half years using straight line depreciation.

To calculate annual depreciation, divide the depreciable basis by twenty seven and a half. Depreciable basis equals purchase price minus land value plus improvements.

When property is sold, the owner may incur capital gains tax. Capital gain equals selling price minus adjusted basis.

Adjusted basis equals original cost plus improvements minus depreciation taken.

Homeowners may exclude up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars of capital gains if single, or five hundred thousand dollars if married filing jointly, if they owned and occupied the home for two of the previous five years.

In the next lesson, we cover 1031 exchanges, Save Our Homes, and common exam pitfalls.

LESSON 18.3 SCRIPT

1031 Exchange, Save Our Homes, Non Deductible Items, Examples

In this final lesson for Unit 18, we examine tax deferred exchanges, Save Our Homes, and items that are not deductible.

A 1031 exchange allows investors to defer capital gains tax by exchanging one investment property for another. The properties must be like kind, and strict time limits apply for identification and closing. Tax is deferred, not forgiven.

Florida’s Save Our Homes amendment limits annual increases in assessed value for homesteaded property to the lesser of three percent or the change in the Consumer Price Index. This protects homeowners from large tax increases.

Certain expenses are not deductible for homeowners or investors. Examples include principal payments, personal expenses, and improvements made to a primary residence.

For exam purposes, remember these rules:
homeowners deduct interest and property taxes only,
investors deduct a wide range of expenses including depreciation,
land cannot be depreciated,
1031 exchanges defer but do not eliminate tax,
capital gain equals selling price minus adjusted basis.

This completes Unit 18. You are now ready for the quiz.
