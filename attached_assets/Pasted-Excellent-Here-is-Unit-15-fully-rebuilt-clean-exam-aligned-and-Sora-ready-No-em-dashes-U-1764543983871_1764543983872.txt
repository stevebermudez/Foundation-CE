LESSON 15.1 SCRIPT

Role of Property Manager, Management Agreements, Authority

Welcome to Unit 15 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

This unit explains the responsibilities of property managers, the management agreement, and the required knowledge necessary to manage residential and commercial properties. Many licensees expand their careers through property management, so these concepts are important for both the exam and practice.

A property manager is an agent and fiduciary for the property owner. The manager’s primary objective is to protect the owner’s investment and maximize net operating income.

The property management agreement is the contract that defines the relationship between the owner and the manager.

The agreement should identify the property, state the manager’s authority, specify compensation, and set the term of the contract. It must also describe the manager’s duties, which may include leasing, rent collection, maintenance, inspections, and accounting.

Managers may be authorized to negotiate leases, hire and supervise staff, approve repairs within a stated limit, arrange insurance, and advertise vacancies.

The management agreement must always be in writing to be enforceable.

Property managers owe duties of loyalty, obedience, accounting, confidentiality, and reasonable care.

In the next lesson, we cover leasing, tenant relations, maintenance, and budgeting.

LESSON 15.2 SCRIPT

Leasing, Tenant Relations, Maintenance, Budgeting

In this lesson, we study leasing procedures, screening tenants, managing relationships, and planning for property expenses.

Leasing begins with advertising the property, showing the property, and screening applicants. Screening includes verifying income, employment, rental history, and credit. Screening must follow equal housing laws.

After an applicant is approved, the manager prepares the lease. A lease should include the names of the parties, the legal description or address, term of the lease, rent amount, payment schedule, late fee policy, security deposit amount, maintenance responsibilities, and termination provisions.

Once the lease is executed, the manager collects rent, enforces rules, responds to maintenance requests, and maintains tenant relations.

Property maintenance falls into several categories.

Preventive maintenance reduces repairs and extends equipment life.

Corrective maintenance repairs items that have failed.

Routine maintenance includes regular cleaning and minor repairs.

Emergency maintenance responds to urgent situations that threaten health or safety.

Property managers must also prepare operating budgets. A budget includes estimated income and expenses for the year. Typical expenses include utilities, repairs, landscaping, payroll, management fees, taxes, insurance, and reserves for replacements.

In the next lesson, we look at income, cash flow, insurance, and Florida trust account rules.

LESSON 15.3 SCRIPT

Income, Cash Flow, Risk Management, Insurance, Florida Rules

In this final lesson for Unit 15, we calculate operating income and cash flow, and we review insurance and Florida trust accounting laws.

Effective gross income is potential gross income minus vacancy and collection losses plus other income.

Net operating income is effective gross income minus operating expenses. Operating expenses include utilities, repairs, salaries, supplies, and property taxes. Mortgage payments and capital expenditures are not operating expenses.

Cash flow is net operating income minus debt service.

Positive cash flow means the property produces income after loan payments. Negative cash flow means the property does not cover its debt service.

Property managers must also manage risk. Techniques include reducing risk through maintenance, transferring risk through insurance, avoiding risk through policy changes, and retaining risk when appropriate.

Common insurance types include hazard insurance, liability insurance, flood insurance, and rent loss insurance.

Florida law has strict rules for handling security deposits and rent money. Trust accounts must be separate from operating accounts. Property managers must follow Chapter 83 of the Florida Statutes for security deposit handling, including notification timelines.

With these concepts complete, you are ready for the Unit 15 quiz.
