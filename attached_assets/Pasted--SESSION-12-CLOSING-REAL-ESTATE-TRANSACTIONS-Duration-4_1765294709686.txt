### SEGMENT 1: THE CLOSING PROCESS OVERVIEW (45 minutes)

#### What is Closing?

Closing, also known as settlement or escrow closing, is the final step in a real estate transaction. It is the point at which ownership of property transfers from seller to buyer, funds are disbursed, and all documents are signed and recorded. The closing process ensures that all contractual obligations have been satisfied and that both parties receive what was promised in the purchase agreement.

**Key Events at Closing:**

*Title Transfer:*
The seller executes and delivers the deed to the buyer, transferring legal ownership of the property.

*Funds Disbursement:*
The purchase price is paid to the seller, existing liens are satisfied, and closing costs are distributed to appropriate parties.

*Document Execution:*
All necessary legal documents are signed by the appropriate parties, including the deed, mortgage documents, and closing disclosures.

*Recording:*
The deed and mortgage are recorded in the public records, providing constructive notice of the transfer and any new liens.

#### Parties Involved in Closing

**The Closing Agent:**

In Florida, the closing agent (also called settlement agent) is typically an attorney or a title company. Florida is considered an "attorney state" for closings, though title companies can conduct closings under attorney supervision. The closing agent serves as a neutral third party coordinating the transaction.

*Closing Agent Responsibilities:*
- Order and review title search and examination
- Prepare or review closing documents
- Calculate prorations and prepare settlement statement
- Coordinate with lender on funding
- Conduct closing meeting
- Collect and disburse funds
- Record documents in public records
- Issue title insurance policies

**Other Parties:**

*Buyer:* Signs loan documents, pays closing costs and down payment, receives deed and keys.

*Seller:* Executes deed, pays off existing liens, pays closing costs, receives net proceeds.

*Real Estate Agents:* May attend closing, receive commission disbursement, assist parties with questions.

*Lender:* Provides loan funds, requires specific documents and conditions be met.

*Title Company:* Performs title search, issues title insurance, may serve as closing agent.

#### Pre-Closing Activities

Before closing can occur, numerous activities must be completed to ensure a smooth transaction.

**Title Work:**

*Title Search:*
Examination of public records to determine ownership history and identify any liens, encumbrances, or defects.

*Title Examination:*
Attorney review of search results to render opinion on marketability.

*Title Commitment:*
Preliminary report showing current ownership, proposed insured, exceptions, and requirements for issuing title insurance.

**Lender Requirements:**
- Final loan approval and clear-to-close
- Appraisal completion and review
- Survey review (if required)
- Insurance verification
- Loan document preparation
- Wire transfer instructions

**Buyer Activities:**
- Final walkthrough of property
- Obtain homeowner's insurance
- Review Closing Disclosure
- Arrange for closing funds (certified check or wire)
- Utility transfer arrangements

**Seller Activities:**
- Provide payoff information for existing loans
- Clear any title defects
- Complete required repairs
- Gather keys, garage remotes, codes
- Review Closing Disclosure

#### The Final Walkthrough

The buyer typically has the right to conduct a final walkthrough of the property within 24-48 hours before closing. This inspection verifies:

- Property condition is same as when offer was made
- Agreed-upon repairs have been completed
- All fixtures and included items remain
- No new damage has occurred
- Property is vacant (unless otherwise agreed)

If problems are discovered during the walkthrough, buyers should address them before closing, as it becomes much more difficult to resolve issues after title transfers.

### SEGMENT 2: RESPA AND TRID REQUIREMENTS (50 minutes)

#### Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)

RESPA is a federal law enacted in 1974 to protect consumers in the home buying process. It requires lenders and settlement service providers to give borrowers timely disclosures about the nature and costs of the settlement process. RESPA is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

**RESPA Coverage:**

RESPA applies to "federally related mortgage loans," which includes most residential mortgage loans. Specifically, RESPA covers:
- Purchase loans for 1-4 family residential properties
- Refinance loans
- Home equity loans and lines of credit
- Reverse mortgages

RESPA does not apply to loans for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes, or to temporary construction loans.

**RESPA Prohibitions:**

*Kickbacks and Referral Fees (Section 8):*
RESPA prohibits giving or receiving anything of value for referrals of settlement service business. This includes fees, kickbacks, or items of value exchanged between real estate agents, lenders, title companies, appraisers, and other settlement service providers.

*Examples of Prohibited Conduct:*
- Title company paying real estate broker for referrals
- Lender providing vacation trips to agents for loan referrals
- Split fees between service providers where no actual service performed
- Excessive gifts to referral sources

*Fee Splitting (Section 8):*
No one may give or receive a portion of a charge for services not actually performed. If a fee is split, each party must provide a real service for their portion.

*Title Insurance Requirements (Section 9):*
Sellers cannot require buyers to purchase title insurance from a specific company as a condition of sale.

*Escrow Account Limits (Section 10):*
Limits the amount lenders can require borrowers to maintain in escrow accounts for taxes and insurance.

**RESPA Permitted Practices:**
- Affiliated Business Arrangements (ABA) with proper disclosure
- Payments for actual services rendered
- Employer payments to employees
- Cooperative brokerage and referral arrangements between real estate agents
- Secondary market transactions

**Affiliated Business Arrangement (ABA) Disclosure:**

When a settlement service provider refers business to a company with which they have an ownership or affiliate relationship, RESPA requires:
- Written disclosure of the relationship
- Estimated charges for the service
- Statement that consumer is not required to use the affiliated provider
- Disclosure provided at or before time of referral

#### TRID - TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure

In 2015, the CFPB implemented the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule (TRID), also known as "Know Before You Owe." TRID combined the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and RESPA into two new forms: the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure.

**Loan Estimate (LE):**

The Loan Estimate replaced the former Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and early Truth in Lending disclosure. It provides borrowers with important information about their loan terms and estimated costs.

*Timing Requirement:*
Lenders must provide the Loan Estimate within 3 business days of receiving a loan application. Borrowers must receive the LE at least 7 business days before closing.

*Contents of Loan Estimate:*
- Loan terms (amount, interest rate, monthly payment)
- Projected payments over loan life
- Closing costs breakdown
- Cash to close estimate
- Loan features (balloon, prepayment penalty, negative amortization)
- Comparisons (APR, total interest, total payments)

**Closing Disclosure (CD):**

The Closing Disclosure replaced the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and final Truth in Lending disclosure. It provides final details about the loan terms and all closing costs.

*Timing Requirement:*
Borrowers must receive the Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing. This is often called the "3-day rule" or "cooling-off period." If certain changes occur that require a new CD, a new 3-day waiting period begins.

*Changes Requiring New 3-Day Period:*
- APR increases by more than 0.125% (1/8%)
- Loan product changes (e.g., fixed to adjustable)
- Prepayment penalty added

*Contents of Closing Disclosure:*

**Page 1 - Loan Terms and Costs:**
Final loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment, loan features.

**Page 2 - Closing Cost Details:**
Itemized closing costs including loan costs, other costs, and prorations.

**Page 3 - Cash to Close:**
Summary of transaction showing amounts due from borrower and seller.

**Page 4 - Loan Disclosures:**
Information about escrow, assumption, late payments, servicing.

**Page 5 - Loan Calculations:**
Total payments, finance charge, APR, total interest percentage.

**Tolerance Limits:**

TRID establishes tolerance limits on how much certain fees can increase from the Loan Estimate to the Closing Disclosure.

| Tolerance Category | Fees Included |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Zero Tolerance (Cannot increase) | Fees paid to lender, transfer taxes, fees for required services from lender's chosen provider |
| 10% Cumulative (Can increase up to 10% total) | Recording fees, fees for required services where borrower selects provider from lender's list |
| No Limit (Can increase any amount) | Prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, fees for services borrower shops for independently |

---

### SEGMENT 3: PRORATIONS AND CALCULATIONS (55 minutes)

#### Understanding Prorations

Prorations are the division of ongoing expenses and income between buyer and seller based on the date of closing. The goal is to ensure each party pays only for the period they own or benefit from the property. Prorations are calculated to the day of closing, with the day of closing typically belonging to the buyer (unless otherwise specified in the contract).

**Proration Methods:**

*365-Day Method (Actual Days):*
Uses actual number of days in the year and month. More accurate for daily calculations.

*360-Day Method (Banker's Year):*
Assumes 30 days per month and 360 days per year. Commonly used for interest calculations and often specified in contracts.

**Accrued vs. Prepaid Items:**

*Accrued Items:*
Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid. These are credited to the buyer (debited to seller) because the buyer will pay them later.

*Example:* Property taxes in Florida (paid in arrears)

*Prepaid Items:*
Expenses that have been paid in advance. These are credited to the seller (debited to buyer) because the seller has already paid for future periods.

*Example:* Homeowner's insurance paid for full year, rent collected in advance

#### Property Tax Prorations

In Florida, property taxes are paid in arrears (after the period for which they are due). The tax year runs from January 1 to December 31. Taxes are typically due by March 31 of the following year but may be paid as early as November 1 with a discount.

**Florida Property Tax Payment Schedule:**
- November: 4% discount if paid
- December: 3% discount if paid
- January: 2% discount if paid
- February: 1% discount if paid
- March 31: Face amount due (no discount)
- April 1: Taxes become delinquent

**Tax Proration Example:**

*Scenario:* Closing date is September 15. Annual property taxes are $3,650. Taxes for the current year have not been paid. Use a 365-day year.

*Step 1:* Calculate daily rate
$3,650 ÷ 365 = $10.00 per day

*Step 2:* Count seller's days (January 1 through September 14)
January: 31, February: 28, March: 31, April: 30, May: 31, June: 30, July: 31, August: 31, September: 14
Total: 258 days

*Step 3:* Calculate seller's share
258 days × $10.00 = $2,580.00

*Result:* Credit buyer $2,580.00 / Debit seller $2,580.00

The buyer receives a credit because they will be responsible for paying the full tax bill when it becomes due, even though the seller owned the property for most of the tax year.

#### Insurance Prorations

Homeowner's insurance is typically prepaid for one year. If the buyer assumes the seller's policy, the seller receives credit for the unused portion. Most commonly, however, the buyer obtains a new policy and no proration is necessary.

**Insurance Proration Example:**

*Scenario:* Closing date is April 10. Seller's insurance policy ($1,800 annual premium) was paid on January 1 and runs through December 31. Buyer is assuming the policy. Use 365-day year.

*Step 1:* Calculate daily rate
$1,800 ÷ 365 = $4.93 per day (rounded)

*Step 2:* Count days remaining for buyer (April 10 through December 31)
April: 21 (remaining), May: 31, June: 30, July: 31, August: 31, September: 30, October: 31, November: 30, December: 31
Total: 266 days

*Step 3:* Calculate amount owed to seller
266 days × $4.93 = $1,311.38

*Result:* Credit seller $1,311.38 / Debit buyer $1,311.38

#### Rent Prorations

When purchasing income property with existing tenants, rent collected in advance must be prorated. Rent is typically prepaid (paid at the beginning of the month), so the seller must credit the buyer for the portion of rent applicable to the buyer's ownership period.

**Rent Proration Example:**

*Scenario:* Closing date is July 18. Monthly rent of $2,400 was collected on July 1. Use a 30-day month.

*Step 1:* Calculate daily rate
$2,400 ÷ 30 = $80.00 per day

*Step 2:* Count buyer's days (July 18 through July 31)
July 18 through July 30 = 13 days (buyer owns day of closing)

*Step 3:* Calculate buyer's share
13 days × $80.00 = $1,040.00

*Result:* Credit buyer $1,040.00 / Debit seller $1,040.00

The buyer receives a credit because the seller collected the full month's rent but won't own the property for the entire month.

#### Interest Prorations (Prepaid Interest)

Mortgage interest is paid in arrears. The first mortgage payment is typically due on the first day of the month following 30 days from closing. Prepaid interest (also called interim interest or per diem interest) covers the period from closing to the end of the month.

**Prepaid Interest Example:**

*Scenario:* Closing date is March 12. Loan amount is $300,000 at 6% annual interest. Use a 360-day year.

*Step 1:* Calculate annual interest
$300,000 × 0.06 = $18,000 per year

*Step 2:* Calculate daily interest
$18,000 ÷ 360 = $50.00 per day

*Step 3:* Count days from closing to end of month
March 12 through March 31 = 20 days (including closing day)

*Step 4:* Calculate prepaid interest
20 days × $50.00 = $1,000.00

*Result:* Debit buyer $1,000.00 (prepaid item collected at closing)
First payment due May 1 (covers April interest)

#### Settlement Statement Entries

Understanding debits and credits on the settlement statement is essential.

**Debits (Charges):**
- Amounts the party owes or must pay
- Reduce the party's proceeds or increase amount due

**Credits (Receipts):**
- Amounts in the party's favor
- Increase the party's proceeds or reduce amount due

**Double Entry vs. Single Entry Items:**

*Double Entry Items:*
Appear on both buyer's and seller's side of the statement. One party's debit is the other's credit.
- Purchase price (debit buyer, credit seller)
- Prorations (credit one, debit other)
- Earnest money deposit (credit buyer only from buyer's perspective)

*Single Entry Items:*
Appear on only one party's side of the statement.
- Buyer's loan costs (debit buyer only)
- Seller's mortgage payoff (debit seller only)
- Real estate commission (debit seller only)

### SEGMENT 4: CLOSING COSTS (45 minutes)

#### Overview of Closing Costs

Closing costs are the various fees and expenses incurred to complete a real estate transaction. These costs are in addition to the purchase price and typically range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount for buyers. In Florida, the contract determines which party pays which costs, though custom and negotiation play significant roles.

#### Florida Transfer Taxes

**Documentary Stamp Tax on Deeds:**

Florida imposes a documentary stamp tax on the transfer of real property. The tax is calculated on the total consideration (purchase price or value).

*Rate:* $0.70 per $100 of consideration (or portion thereof)

*Miami-Dade County:* $0.60 per $100 (single-family residence), $0.60 plus $0.45 surtax for other property

*Paid by:* Typically seller (negotiable)

*Documentary Stamp Example:*
```
Sale price: $385,500
Round up to next $100: $385,600
$385,600 ÷ 100 = 3,856 taxable units
3,856 × $0.70 = $2,699.20 doc stamps on deed
```

**Documentary Stamp Tax on Notes:**

Documentary stamps are also due on promissory notes (mortgages).

*Rate:* $0.35 per $100 of indebtedness (or portion thereof)

*Paid by:* Buyer (borrower)

*Example:*
```
Loan amount: $300,000
$300,000 ÷ 100 = 3,000 taxable units
3,000 × $0.35 = $1,050.00 doc stamps on note
```

**Intangible Tax on New Mortgages:**

Florida imposes a one-time intangible tax on new mortgage obligations.

*Rate:* $0.002 per $1.00 of new mortgage (2 mills)

*Alternative calculation:* $2.00 per $1,000 of mortgage amount

*Paid by:* Buyer (borrower)

*Intangible Tax Example:*
```
Mortgage amount: $300,000
$300,000 × 0.002 = $600.00 intangible tax
Or: $300,000 ÷ 1,000 = 300 × $2.00 = $600.00
```

### SEGMENT 5: TITLE INSURANCE AND ESCROW (40 minutes)

#### Understanding Title Insurance

Title insurance protects against losses arising from defects in title that existed prior to the policy date but were not discovered during the title search. Unlike other types of insurance that protect against future events, title insurance protects against past events.

**Types of Title Insurance Policies:**

*Owner's Policy:*
Protects the buyer/owner's equity in the property. Coverage equals the purchase price and remains in effect as long as the insured or their heirs have an interest in the property.

*Lender's Policy (Mortgagee's Policy):*
Protects the lender's security interest in the property. Coverage equals the loan amount and decreases as the loan is paid down. Required by virtually all lenders.

**What Title Insurance Covers:**
- Errors in public records
- Unknown liens or encumbrances
- Forgery or fraud in chain of title
- Missing heirs or undisclosed spouses
- Defective acknowledgments
- Improperly indexed documents
- Mistakes in recording legal documents
- Undisclosed easements
- Legal defense costs for covered claims

**Standard Exclusions:**
- Defects known to insured but not disclosed
- Government regulations (zoning, building codes)
- Eminent domain actions
- Matters arising after policy date
- Native American claims (federal)
- Environmental contamination
- Rights of parties in possession not shown in public records

**Florida Title Insurance:**

Florida has a unique system where title insurance rates are promulgated (set) by the Florida Department of Financial Services. This means rates are standardized across all title insurance companies in the state.

*Florida Promulgated Rates (approximate):*
The basic rate structure involves a per-thousand rate that decreases as property value increases. The exact rates are set by the state and updated periodically.

*Simultaneous Issue Discount:*
When owner's and lender's policies are issued simultaneously, a discount applies to the lender's policy, typically resulting in significant savings.

In Florida, who pays for title insurance depends on local custom and contract negotiation. In many counties, the seller pays for the owner's policy, while in others (particularly South Florida), the buyer pays.

#### The Title Commitment

Before issuing title insurance, the title company issues a title commitment (also called title binder or preliminary title report). This document outlines:

**Schedule A:**
- Effective date of commitment
- Type of policy to be issued
- Proposed insured
- Estate or interest to be insured
- Property description

**Schedule B-I (Requirements):**
Items that must be satisfied before policy will be issued:
- Payment of premiums
- Recording of documents
- Satisfying existing liens
- Obtaining releases or subordinations

**Schedule B-II (Exceptions):**
Matters that will be excluded from coverage:
- Existing easements
- Restrictions and covenants
- Mineral rights
- Survey matters
- Standard exceptions

#### Escrow Accounts

Escrow accounts (also called impound accounts) are established by lenders to collect monthly portions of annual expenses such as property taxes and insurance. This ensures these critical expenses are paid, protecting the lender's security interest.

**RESPA Escrow Requirements:**

*Initial Deposits:*
Lenders may collect at closing amounts necessary to pay taxes and insurance when they come due, plus a cushion of no more than two months of escrow payments.

*Monthly Collections:*
Lenders collect 1/12 of annual taxes and insurance each month along with the mortgage payment.

*Annual Analysis:*
Lenders must perform annual escrow analysis and provide borrowers with an account statement.

*Surplus Limits:*
If surplus exceeds $50, lender must return excess within 30 days.

*Shortages:*
Borrowers may pay shortage as lump sum or spread over 12 months.

**Escrow Calculation Example:**

```
Annual Property Taxes: $4,800
Annual Homeowner's Insurance: $2,400
Total Annual Escrow: $7,200
Monthly Escrow: $7,200 ÷ 12 = $600

Initial Escrow Deposit at Closing:
Taxes: Depends on when due
Insurance: Typically 2-3 months
Cushion: Up to 2 months
```

### SEGMENT 6: POST-CLOSING AND WIRE FRAUD PREVENTION (25 minutes)

#### Post-Closing Procedures

After the closing meeting concludes, several important steps complete the transaction.

**Document Recording:**

The closing agent records essential documents in the public records:

*Documents Typically Recorded:*
- Deed (transfers ownership)
- Mortgage (creates lender's lien)
- Assignments of mortgage
- Subordination agreements
- Satisfactions of prior mortgages

*Recording Requirements:*
- Proper execution and acknowledgment
- Payment of recording fees
- Payment of documentary stamp taxes
- Proper legal description

**Title Policy Issuance:**

After recording and verification, the title company issues the final title insurance policies to the owner and lender.

**Funds Disbursement:**

The closing agent disburses funds according to the settlement statement:
- Pays off existing mortgages
- Pays real estate commissions
- Pays closing costs to service providers
- Disburses remaining proceeds to seller
- Funds buyer's new mortgage

**Document Distribution:**

Parties receive copies of all relevant closing documents:
- Buyer receives: Deed (original after recording), mortgage copies, Closing Disclosure, title policy
- Seller receives: Closing Disclosure, copies of deed, settlement figures
- Lender receives: Original note, recorded mortgage, title policy

#### Wire Fraud Prevention

Wire fraud targeting real estate transactions has become a significant threat. Criminals hack email accounts and send fraudulent wire instructions to buyers, diverting closing funds to accounts controlled by the criminals.

**Common Wire Fraud Schemes:**

*Email Compromise:*
Criminals gain access to email accounts of real estate agents, attorneys, title companies, or lenders. They monitor communications and send fraudulent wire instructions at the appropriate time.

*Spoofed Emails:*
Criminals create email addresses that closely resemble legitimate addresses (e.g., substituting "rn" for "m") and send fake wire instructions.

*Phone Spoofing:*
Criminals use technology to make calls appear to come from legitimate phone numbers, then provide fraudulent instructions.

**Warning Signs:**
- Last-minute changes to wire instructions
- Requests to wire to different accounts
- Pressure to wire immediately
- Instructions sent via email only
- Slightly different email addresses
- Poor grammar or unusual formatting

**Prevention Best Practices:**

*For Buyers:*
- Verify wire instructions by phone using a known number (not from the email)
- Call the title company directly before wiring funds
- Never email financial information
- Be suspicious of any changes to wire instructions
- Confirm wire receipt with title company

*For Real Estate Professionals:*
- Use secure communication methods
- Avoid sending wire instructions via email
- Educate clients about wire fraud risks
- Implement verification protocols
- Use multi-factor authentication

**If Wire Fraud Occurs:**
1. Contact your bank immediately to recall the wire
2. Contact the receiving bank
3. File a report with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)
