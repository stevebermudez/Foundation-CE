LESSON 17.1 SCRIPT

Investment Fundamentals, Risk, Leverage, Return

Welcome to Unit 17 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

In this unit we explore real estate as an investment and the basic tools used to evaluate investment performance. Investors choose real estate for income, appreciation, tax benefits, leverage, and long term stability.

Real estate investment offers several advantages. Leverage allows investors to control large assets with limited capital by borrowing money. Appreciation increases value over time. Income provides cash flow. Tax benefits may include depreciation and interest deductions.

Real estate also has disadvantages. It is not highly liquid. It carries the risk of vacancies, market swings, and unexpected expenses.

Risk is the chance that the actual return will differ from the expected return. Higher risk often accompanies higher potential reward.

Return is the benefit received from an investment. Investors analyze both cash flow return and overall return including appreciation and equity buildup.

Leverage magnifies gains, but it also magnifies losses. High leverage increases risk because debt payments must be made even when income declines.

In the next lesson, we calculate returns using formulas that appear frequently on the licensing exam.

LESSON 17.2 SCRIPT

Cash Flow, Cap Rate, IRV, Cash on Cash, Equity Buildup

In this lesson we apply investment math. These formulas are critical for exam success.

Begin with net operating income. Net operating income equals effective gross income minus operating expenses. Operating expenses include taxes, insurance, maintenance, and management. Debt service is not included.

Cash flow equals net operating income minus debt service.

The capitalization rate method values income properties using the IRV formula.

I stands for net operating income.

R stands for capitalization rate.

V stands for value.

The formula is I divided by R equals V.

To find value, divide net operating income by the cap rate.

To find net operating income, multiply value by the cap rate.

To find cap rate, divide net operating income by value.

Cash on cash return measures annual cash flow divided by initial cash invested. It shows the investor’s return on actual dollars invested.

Equity buildup occurs when loan principal is reduced over time. As the mortgage is paid down, the investor’s equity increases.

Appreciation adds to overall return as the property increases in value.

Investors evaluate these components to determine whether a property is acceptable.

In the next lesson, we study business brokerage concepts.

LESSON 17.3 SCRIPT

Business Brokerage, Financial Statements, Goodwill, Going Concern

In this final lesson for Unit 17, we explore business brokerage and the tools used to analyze business value.

Business brokerage involves the sale of an ongoing enterprise. Unlike real property brokerage, business brokerage deals with intangible assets, goodwill, and operational performance.

A business is considered a going concern when it continues operations with measurable cash flow, inventory, equipment, contracts, and customer relationships.

Goodwill represents the intangible value of a business, including reputation, brand awareness, and customer loyalty. Goodwill may increase purchase price beyond the value of assets.

Business brokers analyze financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

The balance sheet lists assets, liabilities, and equity.

The income statement shows revenue, expenses, and net profit.

The cash flow statement tracks inflows and outflows of cash.

Business sales may be structured as asset sales or stock sales.

In an asset sale, the buyer purchases equipment, inventory, and other assets without purchasing corporate stock.

In a stock sale, the buyer purchases ownership of the corporation itself, including liabilities.

Florida requires a real estate license for business brokerage because it often involves the transfer of real property leases or owned real estate.

This concludes Unit 17. You are now ready for the Unit 17 quiz.
