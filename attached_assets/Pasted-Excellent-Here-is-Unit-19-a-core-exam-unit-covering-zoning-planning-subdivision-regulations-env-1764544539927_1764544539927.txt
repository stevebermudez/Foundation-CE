LESSON 19.1 SCRIPT

Planning Authority, Zoning, Land Use Controls

Welcome to Unit 19 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

This unit explains planning, zoning, land use controls, and environmental issues that impact real estate transactions. These topics are tested heavily on the Florida exam.

Local governments regulate land use through police power. Police power includes zoning, building codes, subdivision regulations, and environmental protection.

Comprehensive plans guide long term development. These plans include goals for population growth, land use patterns, transportation networks, utilities, and environmental protection.

Zoning divides land into districts based on allowable uses. Typical zoning classifications include residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and special purpose.

Residential zoning may regulate density, building height, lot size, setbacks, parking, and the number of dwelling units permitted per acre.

Commercial zoning may regulate signage, traffic flow, and intensity of use.

Industrial zoning controls hazardous activities, noise, and truck routes.

Agricultural zoning preserves farmland and limits non agricultural uses.

Special purpose zoning includes schools, hospitals, parks, and government buildings.

Zoning ordinances also include development tools such as the floor area ratio, density limits, buffer standards, and landscaping requirements.

In the next lesson, we examine variances, special exceptions, and subdivision processes.

LESSON 19.2 SCRIPT

Variances, Exceptions, Nonconforming Use, Subdivisions

In this lesson, we examine how property owners obtain relief from zoning rules and how land is developed.

A nonconforming use occurs when a property use existed before new zoning rules were adopted. The use is allowed to continue because it was legal when established. It cannot expand or intensify beyond what existed originally.

A variance is permission to deviate from specific zoning requirements due to hardship. A variance does not change the zoning classification. Examples include permission to reduce a setback or modify a height requirement.

A special exception, sometimes called a conditional use, allows a use that is permitted only under certain conditions and after public review. Examples include churches or day care centers in residential zones.

The subdivision approval process ensures that land division complies with local regulations.

The developer must submit a preliminary plat showing lot lines, streets, easements, drainage, and utilities. After review and approval, the final plat is recorded in the public records.

Building permits are required before construction can begin. Inspections occur throughout the building process to ensure compliance with building codes.

Certificates of occupancy are issued when a structure meets code requirements and is ready for use.

In the next lesson, we explore environmental hazards that affect real estate.

LESSON 19.3 SCRIPT

Environmental Hazards, CERCLA, Disclosure, Flood Zones

In this final lesson for Unit 19, we focus on environmental hazards and legal requirements for disclosure.

Common environmental hazards include asbestos, radon, lead based paint, mold, carbon monoxide, contaminated water, and underground storage tanks.

Asbestos was used in older buildings. When disturbed, it releases fibers that may cause health risks. Removal must be handled by licensed professionals.

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in soil. High levels are harmful, and Florida law requires that buyers receive a radon disclosure.

Lead based paint was banned in residential properties built after nineteen seventy eight. Homes built before that year require a federal lead disclosure and a pamphlet for buyers and tenants.

Mold grows in moist environments and may create health concerns.

CERCLA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, created the Superfund program. Property owners, operators, and even lenders may be held liable for environmental cleanup. Liability can be joint and several, meaning one responsible party may be held accountable for the entire cleanup.

Flood zones are designated by FEMA. Buyers obtaining federally backed loans must carry flood insurance if the property is in a special flood hazard area.

Wetlands are protected areas requiring special permits for development.

Florida requires disclosure of known environmental defects.

This completes Unit 19. You are now ready for the quiz.
