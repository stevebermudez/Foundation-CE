LESSON 16.1 SCRIPT

Purpose of Appraisal, USPAP, Value Concepts, Principles of Value

Welcome to Unit 16 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

Appraisals are professional opinions of value developed by licensed appraisers. Lenders require appraisals to ensure that the property provides sufficient collateral for the loan.

Appraisers must follow the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, known as USPAP. USPAP establishes ethical conduct, confidentiality, impartiality, and standards for appraisal reports.

Before we discuss valuation methods, we must review the basic concepts of value. Value is influenced by four essential characteristics: scarcity, utility, demand, and transferability.

Scarcity means supply is limited.

Utility means the property is useful.

Demand means people want and can afford the property.

Transferability means ownership rights can be conveyed.

Several economic principles drive property value. These include substitution, conformity, competition, contribution, highest and best use, progression, regression, and anticipation.

Substitution states that buyers will not pay more for a property than the cost of acquiring a similar one.

Conformity suggests that value is maximized when a property fits its surroundings.

Contribution measures how much a feature adds to overall value.

Highest and best use identifies the most productive legal use of the property.

These concepts are the foundation for the three approaches to value, which we will cover next.

LESSON 16.2 SCRIPT

Sales Comparison, Cost Approach, Income Approach

In this lesson, we analyze the three approaches used by appraisers to estimate value.

The sales comparison approach compares the subject property to similar properties that have sold recently. Adjustments are made for differences in features such as size, condition, location, and amenities.

The key rule is: if the comparable property is superior to the subject, subtract value. If the comparable is inferior, add value.

This approach is most reliable for residential properties and vacant lots.

Next is the cost approach. This method estimates the value of the land plus the cost to reproduce or replace the improvements, minus depreciation.

The steps in the cost approach are:
estimate the land value,
estimate reproduction or replacement cost,
subtract depreciation,
add the land value to the depreciated cost.

Depreciation can be physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, or external obsolescence.

Physical deterioration includes wear and tear.

Functional obsolescence includes outdated design or features.

External obsolescence includes negative influences outside the property such as nearby noise or pollution.

The income approach values property based on the income it produces.

Two common methods are the gross rent multiplier and the capitalization rate method.

The gross rent multiplier is used for one to four unit residential rentals. GRM equals price divided by gross monthly rent.

To estimate value using GRM, multiply gross monthly rent by the GRM.

For larger commercial properties, the income approach uses net operating income divided by the capitalization rate.

These approaches are reconciled to reach a final opinion of value, which we cover next.

LESSON 16.3 SCRIPT

Depreciation, GRM, GIM, Reconciliation, Exam Strategy

In this final lesson of Unit 16, we focus on depreciation, income multipliers, and the reconciliation process.

Depreciation is the loss of value from any cause. It may be curable or incurable. Curable depreciation can be cost effectively repaired. Incurable depreciation costs more to fix than the value gained.

Income multipliers are simple tools used for quick estimates.

GRM is gross rent multiplier. It uses gross monthly rent for small residential income properties.

GIM is gross income multiplier. It uses annual income for commercial and larger properties.

Reconciliation is the final step of the appraisal. The appraiser reviews the reliability of each approach and gives weight to the most appropriate one. The result is the final opinion of value.

The sales comparison approach is most reliable for homes.

The income approach is most reliable for income producing properties.

The cost approach is most reliable for new construction, special use properties, and properties with little or no comparable sales.

With these concepts completed, you are now ready for the Unit 16 quiz.
