LESSON 13.1 SCRIPT

Mortgage Instruments, Interest, Yield, Points

Welcome to Unit 13 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

This unit explains how mortgage loans work, how lenders earn money, and how borrowers repay loans. These topics are tested heavily on the Florida licensing exam.

A mortgage loan contains two separate instruments.

The promissory note is the borrower’s written promise to repay the debt. It states the interest rate, loan term, payment schedule, and total amount borrowed.

The mortgage is the security instrument. It pledges the property as collateral. If the borrower defaults, the lender may foreclose.

Mortgage instruments include important clauses.

The acceleration clause allows the lender to require full repayment if the borrower defaults.

The due on sale clause requires the balance to be paid in full if the property is transferred.

The defeasance clause states that the lender must release the lien once the loan is paid in full.

Now let us discuss how lenders make money.

Interest is the fee charged for the use of borrowed money. It is usually calculated using simple interest applied to the unpaid principal.

Lenders may increase earnings using discount points. One discount point equals one percent of the loan amount. Points increase the lender’s yield. For exam purposes, one point typically increases the lender’s yield by one eighth of one percent.

Origination fees are charged for processing and underwriting the loan and are often expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.

Loans can have fixed interest rates or adjustable rates. A fixed rate loan has the same rate for the full term. An adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM, adjusts periodically based on an index plus a margin.

This completes the essential building blocks of mortgage financing. In the next lesson, we examine the broader financial system behind mortgage lending.

LESSON 13.2 SCRIPT

Federal Reserve, Primary and Secondary Markets, Loan Programs

In this lesson, we study the financial system that supports mortgage lending.

Begin with the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve influences credit conditions and interest rates through three primary tools.

The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges banks that borrow directly from it. A higher discount rate reduces credit availability.

Reserve requirements specify the percentage of deposits banks must keep on hand. Higher reserve requirements reduce loan capacity.

Open market operations involve buying and selling government securities. When the Federal Reserve buys securities, money flows into the banking system, increasing available credit.

Now let us discuss the primary mortgage market. This is where loans are originated. Banks, mortgage lenders, savings associations, and credit unions operate in the primary market.

Loans are often sold into the secondary mortgage market. Selling loans allows lenders to free capital so they can make more loans.

The major agencies in the secondary market are:

Fannie Mae, which buys conventional, FHA, and VA loans.

Freddie Mac, which buys conventional loans.

Ginnie Mae, which guarantees securities backed by FHA and VA loans.

These agencies help stabilize mortgage flows and keep housing credit available.

Next let us compare major loan programs.

Conventional loans are not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. They generally require higher credit scores and larger down payments.

FHA loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA does not lend money. It insures lenders against losses. FHA loans allow low down payments and require mortgage insurance premiums.

VA loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligible veterans may receive loans with no down payment and no monthly mortgage insurance.

With these programs understood, we now apply mortgage math in the next lesson.

LESSON 13.3 SCRIPT

Mortgage Math, Ratios, LTV, Amortization

In this lesson, we calculate loan amounts, qualifying ratios, interest portions, and amortization.

Loan to value ratio, or LTV, is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the property’s value.

To calculate the loan amount, multiply the value by the LTV percentage. If a property is valued at three hundred thousand dollars and the lender offers an eighty percent LTV loan, the loan amount is two hundred forty thousand dollars.

The down payment is the difference between the purchase price and the loan amount.

To calculate monthly interest, multiply the annual interest rate by the current principal balance, then divide by twelve.

Early payments in a fully amortized loan consist mainly of interest. As payments continue, more of each payment goes toward principal.

Borrowers must meet qualifying ratios.

The housing expense ratio compares the monthly housing payment, including mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and association dues, to gross monthly income.

The total debt ratio compares all monthly debts, including housing expense, car loans, student loans, credit cards, and child support, to gross monthly income.

These ratios help lenders determine if the borrower can handle the loan obligation.

This completes Unit 13. You are now ready for the Unit 13 quiz.
