# **LESSON 5.1 SCRIPT**

**Brokerage Offices, Entities, Signage, Record Keeping**

> Welcome to Unit 5 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course. This unit teaches the mechanics of how a Florida real estate brokerage operates. To protect the public, Florida requires tight controls on offices, signage, record keeping, and how business is conducted.
>
> Let us begin with the structure of a brokerage office. A broker must register the office with the state. The office must be a physical, stationary building that provides privacy for conducting business. A broker may not operate as a broker from a temporary shelter or vehicle.
>
> A broker may open additional offices, known as branch offices. A branch office must be registered as a branch office if the broker intends to conduct real estate business there more than temporarily. A temporary construction trailer is not automatically a branch office unless business is regularly conducted there.
>
> Every registered office must have an entrance sign with the broker’s trade name if any, the name of at least one broker, and the words Licensed Real Estate Broker or the abbreviation Lic Real Estate Broker. Team names may also appear on signs if they comply with advertising rules, which we will cover later in this unit.
>
> Next, let us talk about brokerage entities. A broker may operate as a sole proprietor, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. Sales associates and broker associates cannot operate independently. They must work under an employing broker or owner developer. Associates cannot be officers or partners that direct the brokerage unless they hold a broker license.
>
> Now let us cover record keeping. A broker is required to maintain business records for at least five years. This includes escrow records, transaction files, contracts, offers, and listing agreements. If the broker is involved in litigation, the retention period extends to two years after the conclusion of the litigation even if that period exceeds five years.
>
> Everything in this lesson ties to public protection. Florida wants real estate offices to be identifiable, regulated, and professionally operated. Proper office registration, signage, and record keeping ensure accountability in every transaction.
>
> In the next lesson, we will examine the heart of compliance: escrow handling and settlement procedures.

---

# **LESSON 5.2 SCRIPT**

**Escrow Rules, Deposits, Trust Accounts, Settlement Procedures**

> In this lesson, we explore one of the most heavily tested areas on the state exam: escrow and trust account rules.
>
> When a buyer makes an earnest money deposit, the broker is responsible for safeguarding the funds. The deposit may be held by the closing agent, an attorney, or the broker. If the broker holds the funds, they must be deposited into a trust account.
>
> Florida has strict deposit timelines. A sales associate must deliver a deposit to their broker no later than the end of the next business day. The broker must deposit the funds into the trust account by the end of the third business day following receipt of the deposit by the licensee. Always count business days, not calendar days.
>
> A trust account must be separate from operating accounts. A broker may place a small amount of personal money in the trust account to cover bank fees but may not commingle client funds with business funds.
>
> If a rental deposit is being held for an owner, the broker has rules under the landlord-tenant statute as well. Funds must be held in a non interest bearing account unless otherwise permitted by law.
>
> Now let us cover escrow disputes. An escrow dispute arises when there is a good faith doubt as to which party should receive the escrowed funds. A good faith doubt may be triggered when the buyer and seller give conflicting demands.
>
> When an escrow dispute occurs, the broker must notify the state within a specific period and choose one of the authorized settlement procedures. Authorized settlement procedures include mediation, arbitration, litigation, or a request for an escrow disbursement order from FREC.
>
> Rental property deposits may follow a different set of rules. Also, new construction preconstruction deposits may be handled under condominium and developer regulations.
>
> Remember that a sales associate may never directly disburse escrow funds and may never deposit deposit checks directly into the broker’s escrow account. The associate delivers deposits to the broker for processing.
>
> Deposit handling and dispute resolution are critical because mishandling escrow funds is one of the fastest ways to face discipline and suspension.
>
> In the next lesson, we explore advertising, compensation, and exam scenarios that tie this all together.

# **LESSON 5.3 SCRIPT**

**Advertising, Compensation, Employment Changes, Exam Scenarios**

> In this final lesson of Unit 5, we tackle advertising rules and compensation, which are common exam topics.
>
> Florida requires all real estate advertising to be in the name of the brokerage. An advertisement must clearly identify the registered brokerage name. This applies to print ads, online listings, business cards, social media posts, and team advertising.
>
> A blind ad is an advertisement that fails to disclose the licensed name of the brokerage. Blind ads are illegal. An ad cannot lead the public to believe a property is being offered by a private individual if it is being offered by a licensee.
>
> Team advertising must follow strict rules. A team name may not imply that the team is a separate brokerage. The brokerage name must appear in at least the same size type as the team name.
>
> Now let us discuss compensation. A sales associate or broker associate may only be paid by their employing broker. They may not receive direct payment from a seller, buyer, or other licensee.
>
> Referral fees may be paid between brokers. A Florida broker may pay a referral fee to an out of state broker if the out of state broker does not physically participate in the transaction in Florida.
>
> When a sales associate changes employers, they may not take listings with them unless the broker gives permission. Listings belong to the broker, not the associate. The associate must update their license record with the state when changing employers.
>
> Finally, let us review two exam style scenarios.
>
> Scenario one. A sales associate accepts a deposit check from a buyer on a Friday evening. The associate must deliver the deposit to the broker no later than the end of the next business day, which will usually be Monday unless Monday is a holiday. The broker must deposit the funds by the end of the third business day after receipt.
>
> Scenario two. A sales associate runs an online ad that includes only a team name and phone number, with no brokerage name. This is a blind ad and is a violation of Florida law.
>
> Keep watching for the key exam triggers: blind ads, escrow timelines, unauthorized compensation, and commingling.
>
> You are now ready for the Unit 5 quiz.
