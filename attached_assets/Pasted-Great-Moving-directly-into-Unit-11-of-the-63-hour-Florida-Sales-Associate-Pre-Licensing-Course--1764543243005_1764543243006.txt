# **LESSON 11.1 SCRIPT**

**Mortgage Basics, Lien Theory, Notes, Mortgages, Loan Features**

> Welcome to Unit 11 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.
>
> This unit explains how residential mortgage financing works. Nearly all buyers rely on mortgage loans, so these concepts are essential for the Florida exam and for real estate practice.
>
> In the United States, states operate under either lien theory or title theory. Florida is a lien theory state. In lien theory, the borrower holds legal title, and the lender has a lien on the property as security for the debt. The lien is removed once the loan is paid in full.
>
> Now let us look at the basic components of a mortgage loan. Mortgage financing involves two separate documents: the promissory note and the mortgage.
>
> The promissory note is the promise to repay the loan. It specifies the loan amount, interest rate, payment schedule, and repayment terms.
>
> The mortgage is the security instrument. It pledges the property as collateral for the debt. If the borrower defaults, the lender may foreclose to recover the amount owed.
>
> A mortgage includes several important clauses. The acceleration clause allows the lender to demand full repayment if the borrower defaults. The right to reinstate allows the borrower to bring the loan current. The due on sale clause requires the loan to be paid off if the property is transferred.
>
> The loan origination process begins with application, underwriting, approval, and closing. The lender verifies income, employment history, credit, and the property’s value.
>
> Mortgage loans may carry fixed interest rates or adjustable rates. A fixed rate loan has the same interest rate for the entire loan term. Adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, have interest rates that change at specified intervals based on an index and margin.
>
> Some loans involve buydowns or temporary reductions in interest rates. A permanent buydown involves paying discount points to reduce the interest rate for the life of the loan. A temporary buydown, such as a two one buydown, lowers the rate for the first years of the loan only.
>
> In the next lesson, we will compare FHA, VA, and conventional loans and review underwriting standards.

# **LESSON 11.2 SCRIPT**

**Loan Types, FHA, VA, Conventional, Underwriting, Ratios**

> In this lesson, we discuss the major types of residential mortgage loans and the underwriting guidelines used to qualify borrowers.
>
> Conventional loans are loans that are not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. Borrowers usually make larger down payments and must meet lender established credit requirements.
>
> FHA loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA does not lend money. Instead, it insures the lender against loss if the borrower defaults. FHA loans allow lower down payments and are often used by first time buyers. FHA charges a mortgage insurance premium that includes an upfront amount and an annual amount.
>
> VA loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA loans are available to eligible veterans, active duty service members, and certain surviving spouses. VA loans may require no down payment and do not require monthly mortgage insurance.
>
> Lenders evaluate loan applicants using underwriting standards. Underwriting reviews the borrower’s credit, income stability, debt levels, and the value of the property.
>
> Important qualifying ratios for the exam include the housing expense ratio and the total debt to income ratio.
>
> The housing expense ratio compares the monthly housing cost to the borrower’s gross monthly income. Housing cost includes the mortgage payment, taxes, insurance, and association dues.
>
> The total debt ratio compares the borrower’s total monthly obligations to gross monthly income.
>
> FHA and conventional loans have different ratio limits. For exam purposes, know that FHA allows higher ratios than most conventional lenders.
>
> Lenders also consider loan to value ratio, credit score, employment history, reserves, and property appraisal.
>
> In the final lesson, we calculate LTV, discount points, amortization, and cover foreclosure procedures.

# **LESSON 11.3 SCRIPT**

**LTV, Discount Points, Amortization, Foreclosure**

> In this last lesson for Unit 11, we apply mortgage math and discuss what happens if a borrower defaults.
>
> Loan to value ratio, or LTV, is the loan amount divided by the property value. If a buyer purchases a home for three hundred thousand dollars and borrows two hundred forty thousand dollars, the LTV is eighty percent.
>
> Discount points are fees paid upfront to reduce the interest rate. One discount point equals one percent of the loan amount. As a general estimate, one point typically lowers the interest rate by one eighth of a percent, though actual results vary.
>
> Amortization refers to the repayment of a loan through regular payments that include both principal and interest. In a fully amortized loan, each payment reduces the principal until the loan is paid off at the end of the term.
>
> Early payments in an amortized loan consist mostly of interest. As time passes, more of each payment goes toward principal.
>
> Now let us discuss foreclosure. Foreclosure is the legal process in which a lender forces the sale of property to satisfy a debt. Foreclosure proceeds through several steps, including notice of default, acceleration, sale, and distribution of proceeds.
>
> In some cases, borrowers may seek alternatives to foreclosure. These include repayment plans, loan modifications, short sales, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure.
>
> The deficiency judgment is important for exam purposes. If the foreclosure sale does not generate enough money to cover the outstanding loan balance and the lender’s expenses, the lender may seek a deficiency judgment from the borrower to recover the remaining amount.
>
> With these key topics completed, you are now ready for the Unit 11 quiz.
