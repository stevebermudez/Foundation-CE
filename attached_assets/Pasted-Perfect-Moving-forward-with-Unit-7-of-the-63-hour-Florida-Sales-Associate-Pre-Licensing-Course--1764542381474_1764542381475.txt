# **LESSON 7.1 SCRIPT**

**Fair Housing, Civil Rights Acts, ADA**

> Welcome to Unit 7 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.
>
> This lesson focuses on fair housing laws, civil rights protections, and disability accommodation rules. These laws exist to ensure equal access to housing and prevent discrimination in every part of a transaction.
>
> Let us begin with the Civil Rights Act of 1866. This law prohibits discrimination in real estate based on race. It applies to all real estate, without exception, and has no exemptions of any kind. If a question on the exam asks which law covers race with no exemptions, the answer is always the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
>
> Next is the Civil Rights Act of 1968, better known as the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act forbids discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status. Familial status refers to households with children under age eighteen or pregnant individuals.
>
> The Fair Housing Act prohibits several actions. These include refusing to rent or sell, quoting different terms or prices based on protected class, false representation of availability, discriminatory advertising, and discriminatory financing.
>
> Steering, blockbusting, and redlining are also prohibited. Steering is guiding buyers to or away from certain neighborhoods based on protected class. Blockbusting is encouraging owners to sell because protected classes are moving in. Redlining is the refusal of loans or insurance based on the characteristics of the neighborhood rather than the borrower.
>
> There are limited exemptions to the Fair Housing Act. These include owner occupied buildings with no more than four units, housing operated by private clubs and religious organizations under certain conditions, and certain senior housing when legally qualified. Senior housing must meet federal age requirements and cannot use discrimination outside the permitted age criteria.
>
> Next let us cover disability law. Disability is a protected class under the Fair Housing Act and also under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA applies mainly to public accommodations such as sales offices, leasing offices, model homes that contain a public area, and short term lodging operated like a hotel.
>
> Under the Fair Housing Act, housing providers must allow reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications for persons with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change in rules or policies, such as allowing a service animal in a no pet building. A reasonable modification is a physical change to the property, such as adding grab bars or a ramp.
>
> The exam often tests which law applies to which situation. Focus on these questions:
>
> * Does the scenario involve public accommodations? This points to the ADA.
> * Does the scenario involve housing discrimination? This points to the Fair Housing Act.
> * Is race involved with no exceptions? This points to the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
>
> In the next lesson, we move into RESPA, ECOA, and antitrust.

# **LESSON 7.2 SCRIPT**

**RESPA, ECOA, Sherman Antitrust**

> In this lesson, we shift to transaction based federal laws including RESPA, ECOA, and antitrust laws that govern competitive practices.
>
> The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, known as RESPA, regulates settlement procedures for most residential mortgage loans. The purpose is to prevent kickbacks, referral fees, unearned fees, and inflated closing costs.
>
> RESPA applies to federally related mortgage loans, which cover most loans through lenders, banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies.
>
> RESPA prohibits referral fees and kickbacks. For example, a real estate licensee may not receive a fee for sending business to a title company or lender. A lender may not pay a real estate broker for referring customers. Payment is allowed only for actual services performed, not for referrals.
>
> Affiliated business arrangements are permitted if proper disclosure is given. For example, a broker who owns part of a title company may recommend that company only if the broker provides written disclosure and does not require the buyer to use the affiliate.
>
> RESPA also requires the delivery of a Loan Estimate and a Closing Disclosure with specific timing requirements.
>
> Next is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. ECOA prohibits discrimination in credit transactions on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or exercise of consumer protection rights. Lenders cannot ask certain questions unless required by law. They cannot discourage applicants based on prohibited factors.
>
> Now let us cover the Sherman Antitrust Act. Antitrust laws protect competition and prohibit agreements that restrain trade. In real estate, the most common prohibited actions are:
>
> * Price fixing
> * Market allocation
> * Group boycotts
> * Tie in arrangements
>
> Price fixing occurs when brokers agree to charge the same commission. Market allocation occurs when brokers agree not to compete in certain geographic areas. Group boycotts occur when businesses agree not to deal with another company or person.
>
> A common exam trap is the statement that commission rates are set by law or by local associations. That is false. Commissions are always negotiable.
>
> Tie in arrangements are conditions where a consumer must purchase one service in order to obtain another. Many tie in arrangements are illegal.
>
> The penalties for antitrust violations are severe and can include criminal fines and imprisonment.
>
> In the next lesson, we will cover state based laws including Florida residential landlord and tenant law and communication solicitation rules.

# **LESSON 7.3 SCRIPT**

**Florida Landlord Tenant Laws, Telephone Solicitation, CAN SPAM, Scenarios**

> In this final lesson for Unit 7, we cover state level consumer laws and wrap up with exam scenarios.
>
> The Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act governs the relationship between landlords and tenants in residential property. This law defines the rights and obligations of both parties, including maintenance duties, access rules, and deposit handling.
>
> A landlord must maintain the property in compliance with building, housing, and health codes. The landlord must make repairs necessary to keep the property habitable.
>
> Security deposits must be handled according to strict rules. The landlord must notify the tenant in writing where the deposit is held, whether it is in an interest bearing or non interest bearing account, and the conditions under which deductions may be made. If the landlord intends to impose a claim on the deposit, written notice must be provided within the time required by law.
>
> Tenants must maintain the unit, keep it clean, and use fixtures and appliances in a reasonable manner. Tenants must not destroy or damage the property and must allow reasonable access for repairs with proper notice.
>
> Now let us cover solicitation rules. The federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act prohibits marketing calls to numbers on the national do not call registry unless there is an established business relationship or written permission. It also limits the times of day when marketing calls may be made.
>
> Florida has its own state do not call list with even stricter penalties. Real estate licensees must comply with both. Violations can result in significant fines per call.
>
> The CAN SPAM Act regulates commercial email. Emails must include a valid physical address of the sender, a clear subject line, a clear opt out link, and must not use deceptive headers or subject lines.
>
> Text message marketing is regulated as well. Texts sent for marketing purposes typically require prior express written consent.
>
> For the exam, watch for:
>
> * A tenant deposit dispute without proper notice
> * A prohibited solicitation to a do not call number
> * Missing disclosures in commercial email
> * Steering or discriminatory statements in advertising
>
> Now you are ready for the Unit 7 quiz.
