# **LESSON 10.1 SCRIPT**

**Contract Fundamentals, Definitions, Classifications**

> Welcome to Unit 10 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.
>
> In real estate, nearly everything you do involves contracts. Listing agreements, offers, leases, and closing documents all rely on contract law. A strong understanding of contract principles is required for the Florida licensing exam and for daily practice.
>
> A contract is an agreement between two or more competent parties that creates a legally enforceable obligation.
>
> For a contract to be valid, four essential elements must be present:
>
> First, there must be offer and acceptance. This requires a meeting of the minds, meaning the parties agree to the same terms.
>
> Second, there must be consideration. Consideration is something of legal value that each party exchanges. It may be money, promises, services, or anything the law recognizes as valuable.
>
> Third, the parties must be competent. Competent parties are individuals who are legally capable of entering into agreements. Minors and persons who are mentally incompetent generally lack this capacity.
>
> Fourth, the contract must have a legal purpose. Contracts for unlawful activities are void.
>
> Contracts may be classified in several ways.
>
> An express contract is created through written or spoken words. Nearly all real estate contracts are express contracts.
>
> An implied contract is created through the conduct of the parties.
>
> A unilateral contract is a contract where one party makes a promise in exchange for the other party’s performance.
>
> A bilateral contract contains promises from both sides. A purchase and sale agreement is a bilateral contract because both parties make binding promises.
>
> Contracts are also classified as executory or executed. An executory contract is still in progress and has not been fully performed by all parties. An executed contract has been completed.
>
> Finally, understand the following classifications.
>
> A valid contract has all required elements and can be enforced.
>
> A void contract is missing one or more required elements and has no legal effect.
>
> A voidable contract is valid but can be set aside by one of the parties. Examples include contracts with minors.
>
> An unenforceable contract appears valid but cannot be enforced in court due to a legal defense.
>
> With these foundations in place, we now turn to contract formation and remedies.

# **LESSON 10.2 SCRIPT**

**Offer and Acceptance, Statute of Frauds, Remedies for Breach**

> In this lesson, we focus on how contracts are formed and how they are enforced.
>
> Every contract begins with an offer. The offeror is the party making the offer. The offeree is the party receiving the offer.
>
> For a contract to be created, the offeree must accept the offer exactly as written. Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror in the manner requested in the offer.
>
> Any change to the offer is not acceptance. It is a counteroffer. A counteroffer rejects the original offer and creates a new offer. The party making a counteroffer becomes the offeror.
>
> An offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance unless consideration was paid to keep the offer open.
>
> Now let us apply the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds requires that certain contracts be in writing to be enforceable. These include:
>
> Contracts for the sale of any real property.
>
> Leases for more than one year.
>
> Options.
>
> Listing agreements and buyer brokerage agreements that involve compensation.
>
> Any agreement that cannot be performed within one year.
>
> A written contract is not automatically permanent. Lawsuits must be filed within specific time limits. This is governed by the Statute of Limitations. In Florida, written contracts have a five year limitation period. Oral contracts have a four year period.
>
> Remedies for breach of contract vary.
>
> Specific performance is a remedy where the court orders the breaching party to perform as agreed. Since real estate is unique, this remedy is often used.
>
> Liquidated damages are damages agreed to in advance. An earnest money deposit may serve as liquidated damages if the buyer defaults.
>
> Compensatory damages compensate for actual losses.
>
> Rescission cancels the contract and restores the parties to their original positions.
>
> With these mechanisms understood, we now turn to the contracts used most often in real estate.

# **LESSON 10.3 SCRIPT**

**Listings, Buyer Brokerage Agreements, Assignment, Novation, Termination**

> In this final lesson for Unit 10, we focus on employment contracts used by real estate professionals and the ways contracts may be transferred or terminated.
>
> Listing agreements are employment contracts between property owners and brokers. All listing agreements must contain a definite termination date and must be in writing to be enforceable.
>
> The main types of listings are:
>
> Open listing. The owner may hire multiple brokers. Only the broker who produces the buyer earns the commission.
>
> Exclusive agency. The owner hires one broker but may sell the property independently without paying a commission.
>
> Exclusive right of sale. The broker earns a commission regardless of who finds the buyer during the listing term.
>
> Buyer brokerage agreements create an employment relationship with a buyer. These agreements must also be in writing and must contain a definite termination date.
>
> Now let us cover how contracts may end.
>
> A contract may terminate by performance when all obligations are completed.
>
> A contract may end by mutual rescission when the parties agree to cancel it.
>
> It may terminate due to impossibility of performance.
>
> It may terminate through lapse of time, breach, or withdrawal of an offer before acceptance.
>
> Contracts may also be transferred. An assignment transfers contract rights and obligations from one party to another. Most real estate contracts can be assigned unless restricted by the contract.
>
> Novation replaces the original contract with a new one and releases the original party from further obligation.
>
> With contract formation, enforcement, and termination covered, you are now ready for the Unit 10 quiz.
