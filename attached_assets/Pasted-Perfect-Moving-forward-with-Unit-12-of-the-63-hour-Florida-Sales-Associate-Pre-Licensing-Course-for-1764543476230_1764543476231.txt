LESSON 12.1 SCRIPT

Nature of Real Estate Markets, Value Factors, Supply and Demand

Welcome to Unit 12 of the FoundationCE Florida Sales Associate Pre Licensing Course.

In this unit, we explore how real estate markets function, what creates value, and how supply and demand influence prices. Real estate markets behave differently from markets for other goods. Property is fixed in location, durable, and influenced by many outside forces.

Let us begin with the four characteristics that create value. These characteristics are scarcity, utility, demand, and transferability.

Scarcity means the property is limited in supply. Utility means the property is useful and meets the needs of potential buyers. Demand refers to the desire to purchase and the ability to pay. Transferability refers to the ability to transfer ownership easily.

Without all four characteristics, value cannot exist.

Now let us consider cost, price, and value.

Cost is the total production expense required to create a property. Price is the amount paid in a transaction. Value is the worth of a property to typical buyers and sellers in an open market.

Real estate markets are influenced by supply and demand. Supply is the amount of property available for sale or rent. Demand is the desire for property backed by the ability to purchase.

Supply is affected by construction costs, the number of builders, land availability, financing availability, and government regulations.

Demand is affected by population growth, employment, wage levels, consumer preferences, and interest rates.

When demand increases and supply remains stable, prices rise. When supply increases and demand remains stable, prices fall. When supply and demand move together, prices stabilize.

Market equilibrium occurs when supply and demand are balanced. The real estate market rarely stays in perfect equilibrium because economic conditions constantly change.

In the next lesson, we study the principles of value and the forces that influence markets.

LESSON 12.2 SCRIPT

Principles of Value, Market Cycles, Forces Affecting Value

In this lesson, we cover the principles of value and the forces that shape real estate markets.

The principles of value are economic concepts used by appraisers and analysts to estimate value. The most important principles include:

Substitution. A buyer will not pay more for a property than the cost of acquiring a similar substitute. This is the foundation of the sales comparison approach.

Highest and best use. Property value is maximized when the property is used legally, physically, and financially in its most productive manner.

Conformity. Value is created when a property is similar in style, quality, and use to surrounding properties. Excessive deviation may reduce value.

Progression and regression. A smaller or lesser quality property may increase in value when surrounded by higher quality properties. A higher quality property may lose value when surrounded by lower quality properties.

Increasing and decreasing returns. Adding improvements may increase value up to a point. Beyond that point, improvements may not add more value than they cost.

Contribution. The value of an improvement is measured by how much it adds to the entire property’s value.

Anticipation. Value is influenced by expected future benefits such as growth or redevelopment.

Competition. Excessive competition may reduce profits and values.

Let us now consider forces that influence value. These forces include physical, economic, governmental, and social forces.

Physical forces include climate, topography, environment, and natural resources.

Economic forces include employment levels, income, inflation, interest rates, and business activity.

Governmental forces include zoning, taxes, building codes, and land use regulations.

Social forces include population trends, household size, migration patterns, and lifestyle preferences.

These forces interact to create cycles in the real estate market. Market cycles typically move through phases such as expansion, peak, contraction, and recovery.

In the next lesson, we explore market analysis tools and highest and best use.

LESSON 12.3 SCRIPT

Market Analysis, Highest and Best Use, Economic Indicators

In this final lesson for Unit 12, we review the basics of market analysis and the economic indicators used by professionals.

Market analysis involves evaluating supply and demand for a specific type of real estate in a specific location. The goal is to understand who the buyers or tenants are, how much supply exists, and what factors influence pricing.

Residential analysis focuses on population growth, employment, neighborhood desirability, school quality, and affordability. Commercial analysis focuses on traffic counts, access, visibility, competition, parking, and trade area demographics.

Highest and best use analysis determines the most profitable and legally allowable use of a property. The use must be physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally productive.

Now let us look at economic indicators. Key indicators include:

Interest rates. Lower rates generally increase demand for housing.

Employment and wage growth. Higher employment and higher wages tend to increase demand.

Housing starts. An increase in new construction is often a sign of market expansion.

Absorption rates. Absorption rate measures the speed at which available properties are sold or leased.

Vacancy rates. High vacancy rates signal oversupply. Low vacancy rates indicate strong demand.

Consumer confidence. High confidence increases spending and investment.

The exam may ask which indicators signal growth or decline. Focus on the relationships between demand, supply, and pricing.

With these concepts complete, you are ready for the Unit 12 quiz.
